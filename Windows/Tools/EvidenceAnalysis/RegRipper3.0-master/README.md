# RegRipper3.0
 RegRipper3.0

WHAT'S NEW

With the GUI (rr.exe), you no longer have to select a profile; instead, select the
hive to parse, and the output directory, and the GUI will automatically run all 
applicable plugins against the hive.  

This capability is included in rip.exe, as well, via the '-a' switch.  As an 
alternative, you can use the '-aT' switch to run all hive-specific TLN plugins
against the hive.  The ability to run individual plugins, as well as profiles, 
has been been retained, as well.  You can see other options available by typing
'rip' or 'rip -h' or 'rip /?' at the command line.

Date Format - There was a GitHub issue posted, asking that the date format be 
changed to be IAW ISO 8601. However, the actual format provided as part of the 
issue/request was IAW the RFC 3339 profile (i.e., space between the date and 
time).

NOTE
This tool does NOT automatically process hive transaction logs.  If you need
to incorporate data from hive transaction logs into your analysis, consider merging
the data via Maxim Suhanov's yarp + registryFlush.py, or via Eric Zimmerman's rla.exe
which is included in Eric's Registry Explorer/RECmd at:
*https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/EricZimmermanTools/RegistryExplorer_RECmd.zip.

The following Perl module files have been modified, and the modified versions are 
provided as part of this repo:
C:\Perl\site\lib\Parse\Win32Registry\WinNT\File.pm
C:\Perl\site\lib\Parse\Win32Registry\WinNT\Base.pm
C:\Perl\site\lib\Parse\Win32Registry\WinNT\Key.pm

If you're using the Windows EXE versions of the tools, this is irrelevant, as the 
modified files are "compiled" into the EXE.  However, if you're installing on Linux,
copy the files from the repo to the appropriate locations in your installation.
